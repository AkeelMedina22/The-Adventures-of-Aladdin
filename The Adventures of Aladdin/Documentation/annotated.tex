Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_actor}{Actor}} \\*Parent class from which all Enemies, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jasmine}{Jasmine}} inherit from }{\pageref{class_actor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_alien}{Alien}} \\*This class inherits from the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_enemy}{Enemy}} class. It is one of the three antagonists of the game. Move\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the movemnet of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_alien}{Alien}}. Attack\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the attack sequence of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_alien}{Alien}}. hurt\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the sequence when the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_alien}{Alien}} is defeated. ~\newline
 }{\pageref{class_alien}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_apple}{Apple}} \\*This class inherits from the Obstalces class. It is one of the two static objects which interact with the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}}. The specific function of this object is related to the health of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}} }{\pageref{class_apple}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_big_guard}{Big\+Guard}} \\*This class inherits from the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_enemy}{Enemy}} class. It is one of the three antagonists of the game. Move\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the movemnet of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_big_guard}{Big\+Guard}}. Attack\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the attack sequence of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_big_guard}{Big\+Guard}}. hurt\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the sequence when the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_big_guard}{Big\+Guard}} is defeated. ~\newline
 }{\pageref{class_big_guard}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_enemy}{Enemy}} \\*This is the Parent class to generate the enemies. This class further inherits from the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_actor}{Actor}} Class }{\pageref{class_enemy}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_factory_enemy}{Factory\+Enemy}} \\*This class implements the Factory design pattern and returns a pointer of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_enemy}{Enemy}} object depending upon the type passed in the constructor of this class }{\pageref{class_factory_enemy}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_factory_obstacles}{Factory\+Obstacles}} \\*This class implements the Factory design pattern and returns a pointer of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_obstacles}{Obstacles}} object depending upon the type passed in the constructor of this class }{\pageref{class_factory_obstacles}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_game}{Game}} \\*This is the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_game}{Game}} Class which runs the game and interacts with all the other classes }{\pageref{class_game}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_jasmine}{Jasmine}} \\*This class provides the move and animation functionality for the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jasmine}{Jasmine}} character. It inherits from the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_actor}{Actor}} class. This class is implemented using Singleton Design Pattern. Move\+Count is tied to the move animation of the character }{\pageref{class_jasmine}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_lamp}{Lamp}} \\*This class inherits from the Obstalces class. It is one of the two static objects which interact with the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}}. The specific function of this object is related to the points of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}} }{\pageref{class_lamp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_obstacles}{Obstacles}} \\*This is the Parent class to generate the obstacles }{\pageref{class_obstacles}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}} \\*This is the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}} class (i.\+e. Aladdin). This class is implemented using Singleton Design Pattern. Move\+Count is an integer tied to the movement animation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}}. Sword\+Count is an integer tied to the basic sword attack animation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}}. Ad\+Sword is an integer tied the advanced sword attack animation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}}. flip is a boolean variable which houses the orientation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}} which is of type S\+D\+L\+\_\+\+Renderer\+Flip.. hurt\+Count is an integer tied to the hurt animation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}}. celeb\+Count is an integer tied to the end game animation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}} }{\pageref{class_player}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_stick_man}{Stick\+Man}} \\*This class inherits from the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_enemy}{Enemy}} class. It is one of the three antagonists of the game. Move\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the movemnet of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_stick_man}{Stick\+Man}}. Attack\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the attack sequence of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_stick_man}{Stick\+Man}}. hurt\+Count is the integer animation count tied to the sequence when the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_stick_man}{Stick\+Man}} is defeated. ~\newline
